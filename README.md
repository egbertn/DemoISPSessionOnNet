# DemoISPSessionOnNet
Demonstrates how to add ISP Session and ISP Cache to an MVC site
"# Demo ISPSession On  the NetFramework 4.5.2 and higher" 

Created at April 27,2019.
Using Visual Studio 2017 and a default 'new ASP.NET MVC project' without modifying the code.  Only ISP Session has been added.

ISP Session is a product that can be found at https://ispsession.io

It allows you to have compatible session state with ASP.NET Core 2.1 and higher (provided you use ISP Session there too).
In addition it gives you amazing caching ability using Redis. ISP Cache, minimizes roundtrip to Redis, 
while still giving the cached data using a JIT pattern.

This project, was a lot of fun creating. Please support it by bying a license so I can continue to improve it in future.
